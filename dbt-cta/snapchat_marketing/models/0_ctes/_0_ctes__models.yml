    description: >
      This is an intermediate CTE used to parse gnarly json indicating which geographies
      an ad squad targets. Our logic assumes that each of these extracted arrays has
      no more than one element per geography type, so we test that assumption here.
    tests:
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "array_length({{ extract_snapchat_geo('region_id') }}) <= 1"
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "array_length({{ extract_snapchat_geo('metro') }}) <= 1"
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "array_length({{ extract_snapchat_geo('postal_code') }}) <= 1"
