This document is about how to contribute to the `dbt-cta` repository (created and owned by Community Tech Alliance).

No matter who you are, if you spot an error, omission, or bug, you're welcome to open an issue in this repo!

## Public contributions

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to our dbt projects! If you're unsure about anything, just [send us an email](mailto:help@techallies.org) with your question â€” or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

* If you see an error or have feedback, the best way to let us know is to file an issue.
* To contribute a specific change to the site, outside contributors will need to fork this repo.

### Branches

Any CTA engineer should be able to make a branch and submit a pull request. Adding the label `dev_deploy` will trigger automatic deployment of your changes to our `dev` environment.

### Submitting pull requests

TKTKTK

Complete the PR message by detailing all fixes and tagging GitHub users who should review the work, with a note about what they should be reviewing. In general:

- If you are not an admin or member of the 18F site team, tag someone who you would like to review and merge your PR
- If you are an admin for the repo or a member of the 18F site team, you are responsible for merging your own PRs **after they have been reviewed and approved by someone else on the team**
- If you have been asked to review a PR, leave a clear message indicating your approval, either through the formal PR review feature or by commenting (at the very least, with a note saying `LGTM`, or "Looks good to me")
- This repository is configured so that all commits are squashed in pull requests.
